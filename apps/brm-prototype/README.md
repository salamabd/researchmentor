# Business Research Mentor — Prototype

Local-first React prototype for the Business Research Mentor (BRM) product.

## Purpose

Guide a business-school student through one research decision at a time, preserving student ownership of ideas and justifications. BRM supports research thinking; it does not write dissertations or replace scholarly judgement.

## Current scope

- **Blueprint:** BP-001 — Choosing a Research Topic only
- **Nature:** Static, deterministic prototype (no live AI analysis)
- **Persistence:** Browser `localStorage` under the key `brm.prototype.v1`

## Architecture

Dependency direction:

```text
React UI
    ↓
Zustand UI adapter
    ↓
BlueprintExecutionService
    ↓
SessionService + BlueprintRegistry
    ↓
Domain + ResearchSessionRepository → LocalStorage
```

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/pages`, `src/components` | Presentation only |
| `src/state` | Zustand React state adapter (no registry orchestration) |
| `src/application` | SessionService, BlueprintExecutionService, session diagnostics |
| `src/domain` | `ResearchSession`, lifecycle, pure Decision Record builder |
| `src/blueprints` | Blueprint definitions, Zod validation, registry |
| `src/persistence` | Repository port and LocalStorage adapter |
| `src/app/composition.ts` | Constructs repository, services, and registry |

### BUILD-003 / BUILD-004 / BUILD-005

Validated Blueprint definitions (including `purpose` metadata) are registered in-process. BUILD-004 coordinates Blueprint-aware operations through `BlueprintExecutionService` so Zustand no longer talks to the registry directly. BUILD-005 adds a pure `evaluateSessionDiagnostics(session, blueprint)` evaluator, exposed via `BlueprintExecutionService.getSessionDiagnostics()` and a compact layout banner. Diagnostics are observational: they do not repair, migrate, or delete student work. Banner copy is covered by `formatSessionDiagnosticsBanner` unit tests; full React DOM automation for the banner is intentionally omitted. There is no remote blueprint loading and no AI.

Authentication, backend services, AI integration, and additional decision blueprints remain out of scope.
